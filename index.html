        >The smell of freshly baked bread wafted through the air as Jane walked
        into the bakery. She took a deep breath, savoring the warm aroma. The
        baker behind the counter greeted her with a smile, offering her a free
        sample of his newest creation â€“ a croissant filled with chocolate and
        hazelnut. Jane couldn't resist and took a bite. It was delicious, and
        she knew she had to buy one to take home.</p
